_Paint Tool Explanation_

The Paint Tool was a project I worked on throughout the fall semester for my COMP 401 (Foundations of Programming) class.
It is an image editing tool that allows for the user to edit images by inputting an image address URL. The different tools
include the paint brush, the blur brush, eraser, and undo buttons. The instructor set up the JFrame and the Pixel Inspector
tool for us.
