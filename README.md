_Paint Tool_

The Paint Tool was a project I worked on throughout the fall semester for my COMP 401 (Foundations of Programming) class.
It is an image editing tool that allows for the user to edit images by inputting an image address URL. The different tools
include the paint brush, the blur brush, eraser, and undo buttons. The instructor set up the JFrame and the Pixel Inspector
tool for us. The program incorporates observables and observers, decorator, JFrame, polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance. 
To run the program, run the ImageEditor.java. 

_Quick Edit Tool_

The Quick Edit Tool was a similar project to Paint Tool. It is an image editing tool that allows the user to edit images by 
adjusting the saturation, blur, and darkness slider. It also allows for the picture to be divided into tiles and shifted around. 
The program incorporates observables and observers, JFrame, and mouse listener. To see all the features of the program, run
FramePuzzle.java, ImageAdjuster.java, and PixelInspector.java.
